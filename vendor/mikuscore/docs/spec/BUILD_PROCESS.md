# Build Process (Single-file Runtime / Split TS Dev)

## Purpose

This project adopts:

- development with split TypeScript source files
- distribution as a single self-contained HTML file

The build process is designed to preserve offline and zero-runtime-dependency behavior.

Scope note:

- This file defines build/runtime artifact constraints.
- Day-to-day quality gate operation is defined in `docs/spec/LOCAL_WORKFLOW.md`.

## Target Artifact

- Development templates: `mikuscore-src.html`, `index-src.html` (editable source templates)
- Distribution artifacts: `mikuscore.html`, `index.html` (generated files, do not edit directly)

## Suggested Project Layout (MVP)

- `mikuscore-src.html`
- `index-src.html`
- `mikuscore.html` (generated)
- `index.html` (generated)
- `src/css/app.css`
- `src/ts/main.ts`
- `src/ts/**/*.ts` (core/ui split modules)
- `src/js/main.js` (generated from TS)
- `src/js/**/*.js` (generated)
- `src/vendor/**/*.js` (optional vendored libraries, local only)

## Build Command

```bash
npm run build
```

`build` SHOULD perform the following steps:

1. Compile `src/ts/**/*.ts` to `src/js/**/*.js`
2. Validate `mikuscore-src.html` tag order (CSS and JS include order)
3. Inline local CSS and JS into `mikuscore.html`
4. Render static landing templates such as `index-src.html`
5. Output generated HTML artifacts

## Related Commands

For verification and daily commands (`typecheck`, `test:*`, `check:all`, `clean`), see:

- `docs/spec/LOCAL_WORKFLOW.md`

## Toolchain Baseline

- TypeScript: `5.9.x` baseline (current verified: `5.9.3`)
- JavaScript output target: `ES2018`
- Recommendation: pin exact TypeScript patch version in lockfile for reproducible builds

## Browser Support Baseline

- Primary targets: latest Chrome, latest Edge, latest Safari
- Compatibility strategy: keep emitted JS at `ES2018` to improve tolerance for older Android Chrome/WebView environments
- Note: very old Android devices may still require additional runtime compatibility checks

## Runtime Constraints (MUST)

- `mikuscore.html` MUST run offline (no network required)
- `mikuscore.html` MUST NOT fetch external CDN/resources at runtime
- all required scripts/styles MUST be embedded or locally bundled
- behavior of generated `mikuscore.html` MUST match development source behavior

## Editing Rules

- `mikuscore.html` and `index.html` are generated; do not edit them directly
- edit `mikuscore-src.html`, `index-src.html`, and files under `src/`
- PRs SHOULD include regenerated `mikuscore.html` when behavior changes

## Notes

- If TypeScript compiler is unavailable, build MAY fail fast (recommended), or use an explicit fallback policy if defined in package scripts.
- This document defines process and constraints; concrete script implementation is tracked separately.
